# nextjs-pkm

A project to explore personal knowledge management in an all in one

Scott Moss on Frontend Masters showed me a bit about NextJS and integrating with OpenAI, and I am hooked! Scott's already taught me how to make my own agents to save the subscription for ChatGPT, but there are other tools I want to try and consolidate as well. Currently my personal knowledge management tools include my own Slack Workspace and Obsidian (with Sync)

I've had many requests to share what's inside my Personal Knowledge Management solution, but it's not really available in a shareable format. I can only give people access to the files I explicitly include in a folder dump of my Obsidian Vault. What if, I was able to share my PKM with ease? While also retaining what I love about Slack - Reminders, Threads, Channels, and combine them with Obsidian style files that are readily shareable

Initially I was worried that I'd have to come up with my own editor and lose the image functionality that I've come to enjoy from Obsidian, but I've learned about a project called Novel, which relies on a blob store key from Vercel, but I don't mind using Vercel, so long as collectively it can provide more value to me than Slack and Obsidian can
